# Contributing to Gajae-Code
Maintainers and their access are listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).

Thanks for contributing. This guide is intentionally short so pull requests land on the right branch with enough context to review.

## Branch policy

Open pull requests against `dev`.

Do not target `main` unless a maintainer explicitly asks you to. `main` is reserved for maintainer-directed release flow, so PRs opened against `main` may be closed and asked to reopen against `dev`.

## Local setup

This repository uses Bun workspaces.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev:doctor
```

To run Gajae-Code from the checkout:

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Focused tests

Run the smallest command that covers your change before opening a PR. Common options are:

```sh
bun test path/to/file.test.ts
bun run check:tools
bun run check
```

Use focused tests first for code changes, then broader checks when the change affects shared behavior or release-critical paths.

## Rebasing onto `dev`

`dev` moves often, so expect to rebase. Two files behave in ways worth knowing about up front.

**`packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` conflicts are normal.** These files have no custom merge driver: if your branch and `dev` both added entries under `## [Unreleased]`, git reports a real conflict. Resolve it by keeping **both** entries under `## [Unreleased]`. Never move an entry into a released `## [X.Y.Z]` section, and never edit a released section — that version already shipped and its notes are historical record.

Resolving one of these by emptying the file is a real hazard, not a hypothetical: ten pull requests across six authors did exactly that within ten minutes of the merge driver being removed, each leaving a one-byte changelog with every released section gone. CI now fails a PR that removes any `## [X.Y.Z]` heading (`scripts/changelog-history-guard.ts`), but check before you push:

```sh
git cat-file -s HEAD:packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md   # expect ~300 KB, not 1
```

If it is already lost, recover with `git checkout origin/dev -- packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` and re-add only your own entry.

**`packages/coding-agent/src/internal-urls/docs-index.generated.ts` is generated and untracked.** `bun install` rebuilds it through the root `prepare` hook, and `bun run generate-docs-index` rebuilds it on demand. Do not commit it. If you see it in `git status`, something forced it back into the index — `git rm --cached` it. A tracked copy inlines every doc onto a single line, which git cannot three-way merge, so it conflicts on every rebase.

## Nightly release operations

The `CI` workflow publishes a scheduled nightly prerelease from `main` at 04:23 UTC. Maintainers can run the same cycle with **Run workflow → nightly-release**, but manual dispatches must select the `dev` branch: the workflow's `release_metadata` gate rejects manual nightlies from `main` or any other ref. The run must pass the complete dev check/test graph before publication, then publishes all public packages under the npm `nightly` dist-tag and creates a matching immutable GitHub prerelease with binaries and package-evidence assets. Do not create or move nightly tags manually, and do not edit package versions or `[Unreleased]` changelog sections for a nightly run; version staging is ephemeral inside CI.

## PR checklist

- Target branch is `dev`, not `main`.
- The PR description explains what changed and why.
- Relevant focused tests or checks are listed in the PR description.
- User-facing changes include a changelog entry when appropriate.

## Exact-head PR verdict gate

Every pull request to `dev` must keep exactly one `gajae.pr-review-verdict.v1` line from the pull request template. The `PR contract / Validate exact-head PR contract` status is produced by a narrowly scoped `pull_request_target` workflow loaded from the trusted default branch. It has read-only permissions, receives no secrets, consumes no caches or artifacts, and executes only the base-owned validator while inspecting the event's immutable base and exact head. The validator recomputes the binary diff digest, requires the head to contain the base, runs the fast GJC state-writer scan against the PR-head bytes, and rejects self-approved `merge-approved` verdicts. `needs-human` and `merge-blocked` are valid review states but intentionally keep the status red until an independent reviewer records `merge-approved` for the current head.

The first PR that introduces this workflow uses a trusted two-phase bootstrap. Phase 1 landed `Dev CI / PR contract bootstrap` directly on `dev`, so its inline validation exists in the immutable event base before the implementation PR is evaluated. Phase 2 enables the isolated `PR contract` consumer in this implementation PR. Review events run only that cheap, read-only contract workflow; they never launch or cancel the affected Dev CI pipeline. The validator still executes exclusively from the immutable event-base checkout and treats PR-head bytes as data.

After the final commit and rebase, compute the digest with:

```sh
git fetch origin dev
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/dev HEAD
git diff --binary --full-index --no-ext-diff origin/dev...HEAD | sha256sum
bun scripts/verify-gjc-state-writers.ts --fail
```

The verdict line must use the resulting lowercase digest and name the independent GitHub reviewer whose effective `APPROVED` review targets the exact PR head:

```text
gajae.pr-review-verdict.v1 merge-approved sha256:<64-hex-digest> reviewer:<architect|critic|human> reviewer-id:<identity> evidence:<review-or-CI-reference>
```

GJC users can opt into fast feedback before `gh pr create` by copying `docs/examples/gjc-hooks/pre/bash.ts` to this checkout's `.gjc/hooks/pre/bash.ts`. Keep the hook project-local: installing it under `~/.gjc/agent` would incorrectly impose this repository's policy on unrelated repositories. The local hook is advisory and bypassable; the server-side status check is authoritative and covers humans and other runtimes.
